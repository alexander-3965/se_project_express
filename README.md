# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end for WTWR (What to Wear?). It connects a mongoose DB to be able to add/delete users and clothing items. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies

restful API, mongoose DB, express, eslint,

### Testing

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
